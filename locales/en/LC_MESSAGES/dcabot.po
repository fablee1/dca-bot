"<b>🔥 What is DCA?</b>\n"
"DCA is a project, which makes quests with cryptocurrency prizes.\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 How to start?</b>\n"
"All our quests start with a QR code which you can scan using our app, "
"after scanning it, you will enter the quest. Your journey begins and now "
"you will need to test your skills, knowledge and savvy. We use various "
"ways to hide prizes, starting with hiding links, QR codes, easy riddles "
"and basic logic for easy quests, ending with different encryption "
"algorithms, encodings, cryptography, steganography and various ciphers. "
"Usually you will end with a 12 word seed phrase from a multi-"
"cryptocurrency wallet, but in future quests we dont exclude private keys,"
" 24 word mnemonics, passwords for them and etc.\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 What do you use in your quests and where can i find more about "
"it?</b>\n"
"Mostly we use AES and RC4 encryption algorithms as well as enigma and "
"many more in the future. You can read online about cryptography and "
"steganography.\n"
"- For AES and RC4 we use <a href=\"http://crypt-"
"online.ru/crypts/\">LINK</a>\n"
"- For different ciphers you can check <a "
"href=\"https://www.dcode.fr/en\">LINK</a>\n"
"- About steganography you can read here <a "
"href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography\">LINK</a>\n"
"- Dont forget about various text ciphers and many more.\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 Do you give any hints?</b>\n"
"As the time goes on and the quest is not solved, we will add up to 4 "
"hints for each quest, you will find them by clicking on the Quests "
"button, where under each quest you will find hints, so make sure to "
"frequently check our bot.\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 Can i find solutions to previous puzzles?</b>\n"
"Not at the moment, but be prepared, soon we will add solutions for all "
"solved puzzles, so you will be able to learn something new and become "
"prepared for the next quests!\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 Whats the prize?</b>\n"
"We do not disclose the prize of the quest, but be sure it depends on the "
"difficulty of the quest. Regarding the cryptocurrency in which the prize "
"is, you will find it out after entering the seed phrase into the wallet. "
"Usually our prizes vary between 15-100$\n"
"\n"
"<b>🔥 Good luck!</b>\n"
